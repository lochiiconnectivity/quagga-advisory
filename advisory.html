	<h1>Quagga Advisory</h1>
        <h2>A patch to support draft-ietf-idr-advisory-00 in Quagga</h2>
	<h3>David Freedman</h3>
	<hr>

	<h2> 1. Introduction </h2>

	<p>Quagga Advisory is a patch to support <a href="http://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-ietf-idr-advisory-00">draft-ietf-idr-advisory-00</a> in the Quagga BGPD. The following features of the draft are supported: </p>

	<ul>
		<li>Supports sending and receiving ADVISORY ADVISORY type messages</li>
		<li>Supports sending and receiving STATIC ADVISORY type messages</li>
		<li>Does not support peer groups</li>
		<li>Does not support rate-limiting</li>
	</ul>

        <h2> 2. Installation </h2>

        <p> You can obtain the latest version of the patch from <a href="http://www.convergence.cx/scripts/quagga.advisory.patch">here</a>, the patch is applied by the following command in your quagga source tree:</p>

	<pre> patch -p1 < quagga.advisory.patch </pre>

	<p> The patch was written for 0.99.15, not tested on anything earlier </p>


	<h2> 3. Usage </h2>

	<p> The patch introduces two new configuration directives: </p>

	<big><b><em>neighbor &lt;neighbor&gt; advisory</em></b></big>
	
	<p>The <em>neighbor &lt;neighbor&gt; advisory</em> configuration directive enables Advisory messages of both types (Advisory + Static) to be sent to and received from the peer. The directive exists in the <b>main</b> BGP configuration portion and use of it sends a BGP <em> Cease Notification</em> to the peer (with subcode <em>Other Configuration Change</em>) which causes the session to be reset such that the Advisory capability can be negotiated.</p>

	<p>Removal of the configuration directive will also cause both a Cease to be issued and the session to be reset such that the capability will no longer be negotiated.</p>

	<b>Example:</b>
	<pre>
!
router bgp 1234
 neighbor 1.2.3.4 remote-as 5678
 neighbor 1.2.3.4 advisory
!
	</pre>

	<big><b><em>neighbor &lt;neighbor&gt; advisory-static &lt;string&gt;</em></b></big>

        <p>The <em>neighbor &lt;neighbor&gt; advisory-static &lt;string&gt;</em> configuration directive sends an ADVISORY STATIC message to a peer enabled for ADVISORY messages,  for the string which can be a maximum of 120 characters in length. The string will be stored in the configuration and sent to the peer at the next OPEN such that the message is continually known by the peer. The chosen ADVISORY STRING for dispatch to the peer is displayed in the output of <em>show ip bgp neighbor <neighbor></em> along with any ADVISORY STATIC string sent by the peer to ourselves. </p>

	<b>Example:</b>
        <pre>
!
router bgp 1234
 neighbor 1.2.3.4 remote-as 5678 
 neighbor 1.2.3.4 advisory
 neighbor 1.2.3.4 advisory-static Please contact +44 123 45678 for support
!
        </pre>


	<p> The patch also introduces a new cli command: </p>

	<big><b><em>advisory neighbor &lt;neighbor&gt; &lt;string&gt;</em></b></big>

	<p>The <em>advisory neighbor &lt;neighbor&gt; &lt;string&gt;</em> cli command will send an ADVISORY ADVISORY message to a peer enabled for ADVISORY messages,  for the string which can be a maximum of 120 characters in length. The string will be dispatched immediately to the peer and if accepted will be logged.</p>

        <b>Example:</b>
        <pre>
advisory neighbor 1.2.3.4 Maintenance about to start, should last 15mins
	</pre>
